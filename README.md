# Teacher's Assistant MySQL, Flask, and Appsmith App

This repo contains the setup for the world's next Learning Management Superapp, Teacher's Assistant, with 3 Docker containers: 
1. A MySQL 8 container for the SQL schema and test data 
1. A Python Flask container to implement a REST API
1. A Local AppSmith Server for the presentation 


To start this program:
* Run `docker compose build` in the terminal.
* Start the containers with `docker compose up -d` so the containers run in the background.

This final stage project was completed by: 
* Mikhail Ankudovych 
* Sophie Sawyers 
* Laura Boelsterli
